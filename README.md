Materials and methods-
     The data that we are going to use for this is a subset of an open source Bank Marketing Data Set from the UCI ML
     During the work, the task of preliminary analysis of a positive response (term deposit) to direct calls from a bank is to solve. In essence, the task is a matter of 
     bank scoring, i.e. according to the characteristics of a client (potential client), their behavior is predicted (loan default, a wish to make a deposit, etc.).

   In this project, we will try to give answers to a set of questions that may be relevant when analyzing banking data:

   What is the share of clients attracted in our source data? What are the mean values ​​of numerical features among the attracted clients? What is the average call duration 
   for the attracted clients? What is the average age among the attracted and unmarried clients? What is the average age and call duration for different types of client 
   employment? In addition, we will make a visual analysis in order to plan marketing banking campaigns more effectively.
